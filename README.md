# GSoC 2021 QMLHEP Evaluation Test
A dedicated repository for finishing the Google Summer of Code 2021 [QMLHEP](https://ml4sci.org/gsoc/projects/2021/project_QMLHEP.html) tasks.
The tasks description can be read [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H2VMVXLmoxLlRAu5bINNKs8R93SN20zL/view).

This completed test is submitted as an application for project ideas:
1. [Quantum Neural Networks for High Energy Physics Analysis at the LHC](https://ml4sci.org/gsoc/2021/proposal_QMLHEP2.html)
2. [Implementation of Quantum Generative Models to Perform High Energy Physics Analysis at the LHC](https://ml4sci.org/gsoc/2021/proposal_QMLHEP1.html)
both from [Machine Learning for Science (ML4SCI)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6508146341707776/).

## General Approach in Tackling the Problem
- **Task I** is trivial and straightforward. The only close-ended task in the test.
- **For Task II, III, and IV**: The first step I always did was familiarize myself with the recent works related to the tasks, primarily by reading research papers and its code implementation. After that, I tried to find exciting ideas to be explored that are also answering the tasks' problem statement since the tasks are open-ended. These ideas usually either came from my experience or other research papers. Then I implemented these ideas into code and ran it. The results will then be analyzed and discussed.
- **For Task V**: I mainly talked about my previous research experience related to the project ideas that I am applying for or quantum machine learning in general. The suggestions made are also primarily from my earlier experience in quantum machine learning.

## Platform
All tasks are done in Google Colab platform.
